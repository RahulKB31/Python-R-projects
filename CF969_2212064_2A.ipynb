    "    In this linear programming method we are here to determine the portfolio of stock, bonds and options that maximises expected profit. We define the object functions as B, S and C. Then we create a linear programming formulation in the matrix format and substitute the constraints accordingly. Then a sequence of min and max pairs for each element in x, defining the minimum and maximum values of that decision variable is given. Since there is no bound we use None. All the decision variables are non negative. Once all the variales are assigned accordingly linprog function is used to find the optimal solution and potential losses. "

    "         In this Optimisation problem the investor wants to make a minimum profit at least 2000 pounds. That is why we are using gurobi pi to solve linear programming problem. Certain scenarios were already defined to us where investor is investing £20000 to invest in stocks, call option to buy 100 shares and a certain way to make stock investment a maximum profit from the three scenarios. We first started up by importing a gurobipy solver as gp and then we created a new model having number of attributes that can be queried or modified. This model is assigned to variable named as model_. This is then used to call the decision variables using addVar() function. The variables Bond, Stock and Call options represents investment and Profit1, Profit2 and Profit3 represents profits in various scenarios. The purpose of creating this is to add a variable to the model. It contains arguments inside a variable which we can define such as Lower bound value(lb) , Upper bound value (ub) , Objective coefficient(obj) , variable type, name and Initial coefficients for column."

The argument of this objective function contains linear expression of profits in 3 different scenarios taking into account the profits made and losses obtained in each of the scenarios.
